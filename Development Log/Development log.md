# CS 225 Data Structures
## Development Log (jibingy2-bojia2-chenxul2-sw18)

#### Week1: April 11 - April 17


Chenxu Liu: 
  
  Build the main structure of Airport class. 
  
  Finish writing BFS. There are several BFS function with different input (the starting airport's airportID, airport name, IATA) and calling these functions will output the path of traversals into a txt file. In addition, the BFS_all function would do breadth-first traversal for every connected component, and thus would traverse the whole graph.

Shuchen Wu:
  
  Further perfect the Airport class, adding more functions and private variables.
  
  Create Country class.
  
  Finish function that constructs a vector of Country type variable and create test function to read values in the Country vector.
  
  Finish function that constructs a vector of Airport type variable and create test functionn to read values in the Airport vector
  
  Finish function that consturcts vectors of Airport pointer through reading the data file routes.txt. The generated vectors contain routes bewteen airports. And create the test function to read data in these route vectors.
  
  Finish some optimiztion on the current code. --April 14. 
  

#### Week2: April 18 - April 24


Bo Jia:
  
  Implement the User-Interface design.
  Instruct user how to test our system step by step:
  For example: 
    1. press 1, 2, 3, 4 to choose specific test type.
    2. in each test, receive the user input as the parameter.
    3. for each test, teach user how to continue and quit test. --April 22.
  
Shuchen Wu:

  Finish Betweeness Centrality.
  Fix minor mistakes in the User-Interface design and make it more user-friendly.
  Add some helped functions.  --April 22
  
  
#### Week3: April 25 - May 1

Shuchen Wu：

  Add final project report.

#### Week4: May 2 - May 8

Bo Jia:

  Update the content and layout of README.md file.  --May 5
  
Shuchen Wu：
  Update Betweenness Centrality algorithm, comments, fianl report, and readme. --May 6
