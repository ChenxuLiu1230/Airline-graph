## Development Log (jibingy2-bojia2-chenxul2-sw18)

#### Week1: April 12 - April 18
Shuchen Wu:


Chenxu Liu: finish writing BFS. There are several BFS function with different input (the starting airport's airportID, airport name, IATA) and calling these functions will output the path of traversals into a txt file. In addition, the BFS_all function would do breadth-first traversal for every connected component, and thus would traverse the whole graph.
