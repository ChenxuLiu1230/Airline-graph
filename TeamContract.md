## CS 225 Data Structures
## Team Contract (jibingy2-bojia2-chenxul2-sw18)

### Communication
#### 1. Team Meetings
   Our team will meat at least once a week every Sunday from 8-10 PM using Zoom. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with jibingy2. If necessary, notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week's meeting. In addition, when the workload of the project is big or there are urgent problems to be solved, the team will also schedule additional meetings in Zoom.
#### 2. Assistance
   Each team member can be contacted through Email, Wechat and Telephone. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails or Wechat messages within 24 hours.
#### 3. Respect
   The note-taker for the week will also serve as the project leader for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.
### Collaboration
#### 1. Work Distribution
   During each stage, the work will be divided into different parts according to the specific content of the task, mainly including independent tasks and two-person tasks, each person chooses according to their own interests and abilities. When no  volunteers, they are randomly distributed equally. And through timely and effective communication, the fragmented tasks will be assigned again to ensure that each phase of the task can be completed as planned
#### 2. Time Commitment
   Every member is expected to work at least 2 hours and at most 6 hours per week to finish the final project. If the work is too hard to be done individually, the rest of the team members should help to solve the issue. Every member should have roughly equal workload, in order to ensure impartiality. It is the whole teamâ€™s responsibility to keep paying attention to the progress of the project. 
 
If anyone is uncapable of doing his task without proper explanation and is not able to compensate for it, further measures can be implemented by other team members.
#### 3. Conflict Resolution
If there are any conflicts within the team, a group vote will be conducted first, and the team will choose the idea with more votes. To break the tie, the team will simply toss a coin to determine. If the conflict is related to techniques, the team will look for support from TA, Professor or Google to make a proper decision.
